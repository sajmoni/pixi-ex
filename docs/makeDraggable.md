```js
ex.makeDraggable(displayObject, options)
```

Makes a `PIXI.DisplayObject` "draggable", meaning that you can drag it around on the canvas. A display object is only draggable within its parents container.

_This function mutates the DisplayObject and adds new fields to it, which probably will make type checkers fail_ 

## Arguments

`displayObject` (Object): The display object to make draggable.

`options` (Object): TODO

## Returns

Nothing.
